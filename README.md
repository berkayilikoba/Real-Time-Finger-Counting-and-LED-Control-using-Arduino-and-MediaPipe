# Real-Time-Finger-Counting-and-LED-Control-using-Arduino-and-MediaPipe
Real-Time Finger Counting and LED Control using Arduino, MediaPipe, and OpenCV detects finger count in real-time by processing camera frames with OpenCV and MediaPipe. The count is sent to an Arduino to control LEDs based on the number of fingers detected, enabling interactive LED control through hand gestures.
